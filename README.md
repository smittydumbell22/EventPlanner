# EventPlanner
# Invitations Made Easy

I wanted to create a program that demonstrates Variables (mutable and immutable). expressions, conditionals, loops, 
functions, and classes all in one simple Kotlin program. 
I chose a simple program that is an invitation to a party or an event. Each recipient of the invitation can:
# Client Side
1. indicate if they plan to attend the event. 
2. sign up to bring something to the event. 
3. see a list of people that are coming to the event, and what they signed up to bring. 
4. the program displays the name that the user inputs, gives more info about the event if they indicate that they are comeing, and displays anything they sign up to bring to the event. 
# Server Side
1. choose from an option menu if they would like to create, edit, or quit.
2. add or remove guests on their invitation list. 
3. add or remove food on their planning lists.
4. the program also displays the guest and food lists and any edits the user makes to those lists. 

My intent in writing the client side program was to make it easier for event planning. I wanted something that displays an invitation, keeps track of the people that indicated that they will be going to the event, and also provide a possibility to keep track of what each individual will bring to the event.

For the server side program I had the intention of making something that allowed the user to creat and edit the planning side of and event.
